Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Configuration
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Copy the file `.env.example` to a `.env` file 
3. Edit the `.env` file to add your Google Place API key

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
